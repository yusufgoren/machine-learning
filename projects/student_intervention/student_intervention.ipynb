    "NB is a technique that is usually applied to text characterization (e.g. sentiment analysis, medical diagnosis) but depending on the normalization of data, it can compete with SVM. Since it does not use many parameters to tweak during the learning process, it makes the model really hard to overfit the data at hand. In contrast, due to the same feature, the susceptibility to noise is high. This technique is applicable to our data since overfitting being less likely helps to deal with unbalanced and small sized data. Also, since these are student records, it is rather safe to assume that there is not much noise involved in the collection of it.\n",

    "#### SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM (with the linear kernel) wants to find separating lines for different classes of features while maximizing the margin. It is widely used in binary classification problems with fewer features, in image classification where feature extraction is in a sense embedded in the kernel choice, in cursive classification, etc. Using the kernel trick, one can also use separating hyperplanes in higher dimensions to reveal non-linear separation boundaries in the original feature space, which adds tremendous flexibility to the approach and which ultimately adds new features to the data at hand. SVM is a strong choice for this data since there are many features (but not too much compared to sample size). Also as an advantage, the choice of the kernel in the algorithm adds versatility to the model. The downside is that our data has a lot of exclusive binary features (that came from non-numeric columns) and my intuition tells me that these features may affect the optimization poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree regression method uses classification trees, where a binary tree is constructed using the features and the end labels are placed at the terminating leaves. Using this tree, the method then comes up with the label given new features. It is used in data mining applications to reveal how to partition the data, in astronomy to classify Hubble's images to count several object(e.g. galaxies, quasars), in text classification in e.g. medicine, etc. In contrast with SVM's single weakness, decision tree algorithms handles the binary features extremely well, thus fitting model to use with our data. On the other hand, they are very susceptible to overfitting and learning might take much longer than the other algorithms, so we must be careful while choosing parameters for the algorithm.\n",

Also, it seems like prediction times are also higher than the other ones. Choosing between SVM and Gaussian NB is challenging. As you can see in the table above, both models increasingly fit the training data better and also performs rather well on the testing set. One thing to notice here is that SVM has significantly higher training scores; thus, after fine-tuning its parameters, it is expected to perform better than Gaussian NB. On the other hand, refering to the elapsed times for the models, it is apparent that SVM gets computationally costly as number of samples increase. Therefore, depending on the size of the data, we might prefer to train a Gaussian NB model.\n",

What it does is that through a transformation in space (possibly while increasing the dimensionality), it reveals a linear separator.

    "As you can see below, our final tuned model has a better (not extremely, but still higher) final training _and_ testing score than the original one . I think I would conclude that it's better to convert binary categories into single binary feature rather than two. Similarly, given a feature with $n$ categories, instead of replacing it with $n$ features, we might want to try making $\\lceil \\lg n \\rceil$ features (e.g. if we have a feature $F$ with choices, say, $\\{0,1,2,3\\}$, I would have two binary features $F_1$ and $F_2$ such that the correspondence is\n",
